Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
The fries were great too.
A great touch.
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.
- They never brought a salad we asked for.
"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff."
"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed."
The worst was the salmon sashimi.
"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal."
This was like the final blow!
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
"Overall, I like this place a lot."
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.
Ample portions and good prices.
"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!
Service sucks.
The shrimp tender and moist.
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service."
"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register."
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
"The burger is good beef, cooked just right."
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
"My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing."
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.
Their chow mein is so good!
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.
The staff was very attentive.
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).
"The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price."
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
dont go here.
This is a GREAT place to eat!
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
The service was poor and thats being nice.
"Food was good, service was good, Prices were good."
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather."
But the service was beyond bad.
"I'm so happy to be here!!!"""
Tasted like dirt.
Spend your money and time some place else.
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
the presentation of the food was awful.
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
Appetite instantly gone.
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.
We'd definitely go back here again.
We are so glad we found this place.
"Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount."
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
A great way to finish a great.
"The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected."
"- Really, really good rice, all the time."
The service was meh.
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
Appetite instantly gone.
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
"The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily."
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
We will not be coming back.
"I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well."
"The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff."
"Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service."
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
Once your food arrives it's meh.
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too."
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.
"The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh."
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mediocre food.
